# Drag & Drop Composer

Hello!  
This simple application was build using Next.js.    
It requires **Node.js 18+** to run (I've used **node v18.16.0** and **npm v9.5.1**) 

---

## Run the application

You can easily see it in action by either:

### Preview it locally

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev

// or

npm run build
npm run start
```

### Build and run it by using Docker (and docker-compose)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Notes
The app itself doesn't have a real purpose, but it's more a showcase of a few practices/patterns.
- inheritance
- factory pattern
- editor pattern
